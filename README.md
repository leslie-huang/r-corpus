*Corpus* is an R text processing package with full support for international
text (Unicode). It includes functions for reading data from newline-delimited
JSON files, for normalizing and tokenizing text, for searching for term
occurrences, and for computing term occurrence frequencies (including
n-grams).

*Corpus* does not provide any language models, part-of-speech tagging, topic
models, or word vectors, but it can be used in conjunction with other packages
that provide these features.

Corpus was built and maintained from 2017--2020 by [Patrick Perry](https://github.com/patperry/). It is currently maintained by [Leslie Huang](https://github.com/leslie-huang).


Installation
------------

### Stable version

*Corpus* is [available on CRAN][cran].To install the latest released version,
run the following command in R:

    install.packages("corpus")


### Development version

To install the latest development version, run the following:

    tmp <- tempfile()
    system2("git", c("clone", "--recursive",
                     shQuote("https://github.com/leslie-huang/r-corpus.git"), shQuote(tmp)))
    devtools::install(tmp)

Note that *corpus* uses a git submodule, so you cannot use
`devtools::install_github`.


Usage
-----

Here's how to get the most common non-punctuation, non-stop-word terms in *The
Federalist Papers*:

    > term_stats(federalist, drop = stopwords_en, drop_punct = TRUE)
       term         count support
    1  government     825      85
    2  state          787      85
    3  people         612      85
    4  one            544      85
    5  new            324      85
    6  york           151      85
    7  publius         85      85
    8  may            812      84
    9  states         845      82
    10 power          606      82
    11 must           446      81
    12 can            464      78
    13 every          350      77
    14 part           226      77
    15 constitution   462      76
    16 might          322      76
    17 general        255      76
    18 time           249      76
    19 great          291      74
    20 public         282      74
    ⋮  (8631 rows total)

Here's how to find all instances of tokens that stem to "power":

    > text_locate(federalist, "power", stemmer = "en")
       text             before              instance              after

Here's how to get a term frequency matrix of all 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-grams.

    > system.time(x <- term_matrix(federalist, ngrams = 1:5))
       user  system elapsed
      2.781   0.123   2.906

This computation uses only a single CPU, yet it still completes in under three
seconds.

==================

### BUG FIXES

   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2020-February/079061.html

corpus 0.10.0.9000
==================

(no changes)


corpus 0.10.0 (2017-12-12)
==========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Implement `length<-` for `corpus_text` objects.

  * Added `str()` method for `corpus_text` objects. Currently just a minimal
    implementation; this may change in the future.

  * Add ANSI styling to `corpus_frame` objects.

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * Remove `text_length()`. Use `text_ntoken()` instead.

  * Remove `as_utf8()`, `utf8_valid()`, `utf8_normalize()`,
    `utf8_encode()`, `utf8_format()`, `utf8_print()`, and `utf8_width()`;
    these functions are in the *utf8* package now.


corpus 0.9.4 (2017-10-31)
=========================

### BUG FIXES

  * Fix bug in `print.corpus_frame(,row.names = FALSE)`.

  * Fix failing test on R-devel.

    of (term, stem) pairs.

  * Add `stem_snowball()` function for the Snowball stemming algorithms
    (similar to SnowballC::wordStem, but only stemming "letter" tokens,
    not "number", "punct", or "symbol").

  * Apply filter combine rules before stemming rather than after.

  * Remove dropped tokens rather than replace them with `NA`.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Replace white-space in types with connector (`_`).

  * Switch to `"radix"` sort algorithm for consistent, fast term ordering
    on all platforms, regardless of locale.

  * Set `combine = NULL` be default for text filters.

    `corpus_frame` and `corpus_text`.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Switch `as_utf8()` default argument to `normalize = FALSE`.

  * Re-order `as_corpus_text()` and `as_corpus_frame()` arguments; make
    both accept `...` arguments to override individual text filter properties.

  * Add missing single-letter initials to English abbreviation list.

  * Adaptively increase buffer size for `read_ndjson()` so that large
    files can be read quickly.

  * Make `summary()` on a `corpus_text` object report statistics for the
    number of tokens and types.

  * Switch to 2-letter language codes for stemming algorithms.

### BUG FIXES

    `as_corpus_frame()` and `is_corpus_frame()` to avoid name clashes with
    other packages.

  * Renamed `as_text()` and `is_text()` to `as_corpus_text()` and
    `is_corpus_text()` to avoid name clashes with other packages.

  * Rename `term_frame()` to `term_counts()`.

  * Following quanteda, add "will" to the English stop word list.

  * Add special handling for hyphens so that, for example, "world-wide"
    is a single token (but "-world-wide-" is three tokens).

  * Merged "url" and "symbol" word categories.  Removed "other" word
    category (ignore these characters).

  * Change stemmer so that it only modifies tokens of kind "letter",
    preserving "number", "symbol", "url", etc.

  * Added `text_filter()` generic.

  * Added `text_filter()<-` setter for text vectors.

  * Use a text's `text_filter()` attribute as a default in all `text_*`
    functions expecting a filter argument.

  * Added functions for validating and converting to UTF-8: `as_utf8()`,
    `utf8_valid()`.

  * Added functions for formatting and printing utf8 text: `utf8_encode()`,
    `utf8_format()`, `utf8_print()`, `utf8_valid()`, and `utf8_width()`.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Handle @mentions, #hashtags, and URLs in word tokenizer.

  * `term_counts()` now reports the `support` for each term (the number of
    texts containing the term), and has options for restricting output by
    the minimum and maximum support.

  * Added new class `corpus_frame` to support better printing of
    data frame objects: left-align text data, truncate output to screen
    width, display emoji on Mac OS. Use this class for all data frame

=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Add `text_locate()`, for searching for specific terms in text,
    reporting the contexts of the occurrences ("Key words in context").

  * Add `text_count()` and `text_detect()` for counting term occurrences or
    checking for a term's existence in a text.

  * Add `text_types()` and `text_ntype()` for returning the unique types in
    a text, or counting types.

  * Add `text_nsentence()` for counting sentences.

    columns `"text"`, `"term"`, and `"count"`.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Add new version of `format.corpus_text()` that is faster and aware
    of character widths, in particular, Emoji and East Asian character
    widths.

  * Normalize token filter `combine`, `drop`, `drop_except`, `stem_except`
    arguments, to allow passing cased versions of these arguments.

  * Set `combine = abbreviations("english")` by default.

=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Add `ngrams` options for `term_counts()` and `term_matrix()`.

  * Add sentence break suppressions (special handling for abbreviations);
    the default behavior for `text_split(, "sentences")` is to use a set of
    English abbreviations as suppressions.

  * Add option to treat CR and LF like spaces when determining sentence
    boundaries; this is now the default.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

### BUG FIXES

  * Fix bug in `read_ndjson()` for reading factors with missing values.


corpus 0.5.0 (2017-05-23)
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Add `term_counts()` function to tabulate term frequencies.

  * Add `term_matrix()` function to compute a term frequency matrix.

  * Add `text_filter()` option (`stem_except`) to exempt specific terms from
    stemming.

  * Add `text_filter()` option (`drop`) to drop specific terms, along with
    option (`drop_except`) to exempt specific terms from dropping.

  * Add `text_filter()` option (`combine`) to combine multi-word phrases like
    "new york city" into a single term.

    all words that are not on this list).

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Add `stopwords()` function.

  * Make `read_ndjson()` decode JSON strings as character or factor (according
    to whether `stringsAsFactors` is `TRUE`) except for fields named `"text"`,
    which get decoded as text objects.

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * Rename `text_filter()` options `fold_case`, `fold_dash`, `fold_quote`
    to `map_case`, `map_dash`, `map_quote`.


corpus 0.4.0 (2017-05-16)
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Allow `read_ndjson()` to read from connections, not just files, by
    reading the file contents into memory first. Use this by default
    instead of memory mapping.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Add `text_filter()` options `drop_symbol`, `drop_number`, `drop_letter`,
    `drop_kana`, and `drop_ideo`; these options replace the matched tokens

  * Rename `"dataset"` type to `"jsondata"`.


corpus 0.2.0 (2017-04-15)
